A postmortem is a structured review or analysis of a past incident or outage within an organization's systems or processes. It is typically conducted to:

Identify the root causes of the issue or incident.
Understand the impact of the incident on the organization, its users, and its systems.
Document the timeline of events, including how the incident was detected and resolved.
Analyze any misleading paths taken during the investigation.
Determine which teams or individuals were involved in addressing the incident.
Outline corrective and preventative measures to avoid similar incidents in the future.
The goal of a postmortem is to learn from past mistakes, improve processes, enhance system reliability, and prevent the recurrence of similar issues. It provides valuable insights and helps teams and organizations become more resilient and proactive in addressing challenges.
